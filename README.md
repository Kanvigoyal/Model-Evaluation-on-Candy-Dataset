![enter image description here](https://github.com/Kanvigoyal/Model-Evaluation-on-Candy-Dataset/blob/main/Halloween%20Candies.jpg?raw=true)

Each row in the candy dataset corresponds to one type of Halloween candy. Participants are shown different candies two at time and are asked which candy do they prefer. After aggregating all the votes, each candy is given winpercent. Winpercent is the overall win percentage according to 269,000 matchups.

Here we are asked to make a model which would help us predict the winpercent of a candy; basis it's various other characteristics.

This project was created as a part of INSAID machine learning foundation project.
